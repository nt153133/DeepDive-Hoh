# DeepDive-Hoh

If you're going to try and run solo please make sure to have 99 max-potions (they'll restock as it runs) and set magitek self-healing for your class to heal at about 80%. Even still you'll probably die like 5 times on floor 1 till you get lucky but once it gets past floor 2 you should be generally ok. You will also die more if you're aethergear is 0. Use a class that runs well like RDM with veracure at 80% and let it run over night till you get some aethergear.
